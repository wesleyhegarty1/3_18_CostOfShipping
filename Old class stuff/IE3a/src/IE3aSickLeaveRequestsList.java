/** TOTAL = 5 points
   This class models information about a list of sick leave requests
   and provides a few useful methods to manage them.
   The code below compiles but is missing critical parts that you need to write. 
   Look for the TASK tags to tell you what you need to write.
   You may work on these tasks in a different order but they are numbered
   so as to provide you with a logical order to follow.

      Declare the following attributes:
         requests    of data type   ArrayList of IE3aSickLeaveRequest
         totalDays   of data type   integer
   */

   
   /* TASK #2 - 1 point
      Write the code for the following constructor so that it
      initializes appropriately all attributes.

   /* TASK #3 - 1 point
      Write a method that allows you to add an already created
      IE3SickLeaveRequest object to our ArrayList attribute (.5 point).
      Simply ignore requests to add null references (.25 point)
      and increment totalDays by the number of days of the request
      being added (.25 point).

   /* TASK #4 - 2 points
      Write a method that returns a string describing,
      one per line, each of the sick leave requests stored
      in the attribute requests.
      To get full credit make sure you use a for-each loop.
