   Artifact class. To do so, you are free to create several objects,
   call methods...

      Write your tests in this main method.
      You will be graded on the thoroughness of your tests; 
         1 point  main code tests each of the available methods at least once, 
                  this includes testing object creation with all available constructors
         1 point  In addition, methods are tested on parameters that they should reject
                  or handle as special cases; e.g., trying to pass a tax parameter outside
                  the valid range.
         1 point  All tests result in clear information being displayed on the screen
                  so that, by just reading the programs' output, we can understand exactly
                  what has been tested, with what values, and what was the result or
                  consequences of running the test.

What is the difference between declaring and initializing an attribute?

An attribute is just something that is descriptive of an object, right?

What EXACTLY is an argument?
